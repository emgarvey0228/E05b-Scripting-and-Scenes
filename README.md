# E05b-Scripting-and-Scenes
In this assigment, I learned how to edit code and add in assets such as having a point and lives system. I also learned how to carefully create and save a new Scene. In this game, use your mouse to control your paddle as you try to keep the ball from falling past you. Hint: hitting as many tiles as you can will result in a bigger score!
